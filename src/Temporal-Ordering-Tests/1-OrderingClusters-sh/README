OrderingClusters-sh :

* OrderingClusters.sh

- Why :
  Add a temporal order on each cluster for ordering them
  (Propose positions for each cluster)
- What :
  Fragments of past cases are organized temporarily with significative terms
  in each parts
- How :
  Past cases knowledge has been transformed into documents which were
  cut into N parts. The most significative words in these parts are highlighted
  and used as ordered references.
  Past cases knowledge has also been cut into fragments of words : clusters.
  The fragments are ordered based on the words they contains and the ordering
  proposed by the significative words and their parts.
