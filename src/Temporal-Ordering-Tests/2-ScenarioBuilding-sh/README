ScenarioBuilding-sh :

* ScenarioBuilding.sh

- Why :
  Propose one or multiple scenario(s) of execution from past cases executions
- What :
  Temporarily ordered fragments of past cases are dispatched in parts
- How :
  Fragments containing significative terms from precise parts are organiazed.
  The biggest fragments with a part number are shown first in each part,
  then, the smallest fragments with a part number are shown,
  and finally, fragments without part number are proposed.


Temporarily ordered fragments input :
Concept ID ; Level ; Type Obj/Attr/Part ; Nb Obj ; Nb Attr ; Nb Part ; Object1/Attribute1/Part1 ; Obj2/Attr2/Part2 ; ...

Output :
    Part 0   |   Part 1   |   Part 2   |   Part 3
  Fragment 1 | Fragment 1 | Fragment 4 | [Unordered Fragment]
 [Unordered] | Fragment 2 | Fragment 2 |
             | Fragment 3 | [Unordered]|
             | [Unordered]|
