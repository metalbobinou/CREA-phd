* Extractor :

- Why : Create files with only core information to be reused by other scripts.
- What : Reference files (with only terms, only BabelNet ID, ...) are required
  by other scripts for processing.
- How : The occurrences matrix is read and transformed into multiples lists.
  A list with terms only, documents only, ID of terms/documents, matrix with
  ID of terms/documents, occurrences matrix extended with IDs around.


* Replaceator :

- Why : Softwares require only integers as input (instead of texts).
- What : The terms and documents are therefore replaced by their IDs created in
  "Extractor" step.
- How : The "Extractor" step created lists of ID's for terms and documents,
  they are used to replace their appearences in the Fragments (Formal Concepts)


* Add-Letter-1st-*.sh :

- Add 1 letter in each column of 1st line/each 1st column of each line


1-Extract-1st-col.sh :
Uses a formal context as an input (a matrix with sources and terms).
Generates extracts where sources/terms are replaced by a reference number:
- cols_* : lists the terms and their numbers horizontally
- colstrans_* : lists the terms and their numbers vertically (required next)
- lines_* : lists the sources and their numbers vertically
- enhanced_* : add one line and one column of numbers around the matrix
- numbered_* : change the sources and terms by their numbers



2-Replaceator.sh :
Transforms the list of fragments given in $2 by its references from previous
step. The attributes are transformed into their numbers.
The reference file in $1 must be of the format (usually colstrans_* or lines_*) :
[Ref] ; [Term]
1 ; "city bn:4431090"
2 ; "lol bn:42424242"
...
The list of fragments must be of the format :
[Concept ID] ; [Level] ; [Type] ; [Nb Objects] ; [Nb Attributes] ; Obj/Attr1 ; Obj/Attr2 ; ...
1 ; 0 ; Objects ; 2 ; 4 ; "city bn:0000123" ; "lol bn:42424242"
2 ; 0 ; Objects ; 1 ; 8 ; "lol bn:42424242"
...

Usage:
./Replaceator.sh ref-file.csv data-file.csv

The output are:
- replaced_* : concepts objects/attributes are replaced by numbers
- list_* : objects/attributes are separated by "\t", and transactions by "\n"

The list_* files are perfect for use with A Priori algorithms


Add-Letter-1st-*.sh :
./Add*.sh file1.csv file2.csv ...
