CounterDotX :

- Why : Find the most dense matrix (but not too much) after the strategy
  calculus.
- What : The 0 and 1 should be well proportionned (neither too few nor too
  much)
- How : The generated matrix from the Formal Concept Analysis are read and the
  0 and 1 are counted in the resulted matrix. A proportion of 0/1 is
  calculated.


1) Put a matrix of X and . in a file (like FILE.txt)

2) Launch: sh CounterDotX.sh FILE.txt
