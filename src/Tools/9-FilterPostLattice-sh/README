FilterPostLattice :

Filter the fragments (concepts) following rules.
Rules :
1) object (terms) must not be empty
2) at least 2 objects (terms) are required


- Why : Fragments generated by FCA (the Formal Concepts) with few knowledge to
  be reused are removed.
- What : Some generated fragments not embed useful knowledge (like those with
  1 term or 1 document).
- How : We filter the fragments by keeping only those that contains "at least"
  2 terms or 2 documents.


1) Put a CSV of this format as an input :
Concept ID ; Level ; Type Obj/Attr ; Nb Obj ; Nb Attr ; Object1/Attribute1 ; Obj2/Attr2 ; ...

2) Launch the filter :
sh FilterPostLattice.sh  file1 file2 ...


Output :

Concept ID ; Level ; Type Obj/Attr ; Nb O ; Nb A ; Obj1/Attr1 ; O/A2 ; ...
