Case REuse and Adaptation - Method for building syllabus and sessions for a new course from a set of existing courses [Tools as is for my PhD defense in january 2022]

This is the exact set of tools developped for my PhD defense the january 17th 2022.

The current state of the CREA method is available in another Git repository : [CREA](https://github.com/metalbobinou/CREA)

The thesis manuscript (in french) can be found here : [PhD Thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03774087v1)

The data generated with this version and for the manuscript can be found here : [CREA-PhD-Data](https://github.com/metalbobinou/CREA-phd-data)

# Requirements
Multiple languages were used because of the successive tests and explorations.
Each part has its own requirements, just check each README.

Just keep in mind that everything was written with :
- sh
- awk
- C
- C++
- Python
- Java
- PHP

The newer version of CREA is being rewritten in Python in order to reduce complexity of dependencies.
Maybe a C/C++ version will be added for performances.
